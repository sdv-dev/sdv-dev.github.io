      <h1>What is Synthetic Data Vault?</h1>
      <p class="des">
      The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) enables end users to easily generate <i>Synthetic Data</i>
      for different data modalities, including <i>single table</i>, <i>multi-table</i> and
      <i>time series</i> data. With this ecosystem, we are releasing several years of our work
      building, testing and evaluating algorithms and models geared towards synthetic data
      generation. On this site you will find a number of open-source libraries, tutorials and
      other useful resources. We are constantly improving algorithms, APIs, and benchmarking
      methods to give you access to the latest innovations in the field. Try it, test it and
      give us feedback!
