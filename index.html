      The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) enables end users to easily generate synthetic data synthetic
      data for different data modalities, including single table, relational and time series data.
      With this ecosystem, we are releasing several years of our work building, testing and
      evaluating algorithms and models geared towards synthetic data generation. On this site you
      will find a number of open-source libraries, tutorials and other useful resources.
      We are constantly improving algorithms, user apis, and benchmarking methods to give you
      access to the latest innovations in the field. Try it, test it and give us feedback!
