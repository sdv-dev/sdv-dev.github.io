      <h1>What is Synthetic Data Vault?</h1>
      <p class="des">
      Synthetic data vault is an ecosystem that comprises several open source
      libraries, tutorials and resources for end users to use synthetic data
      generation techniques. Through this ecosystem weâ€™re open sourcing several
      years of research. Within this ecosystem you would find latest algorithms/methods
      to learn models from and generate synthetic data for different data modalities
      - single table, relational and time series data. We also provide methods to
      evaluate the quality and efficacy of the synthetic data and a benchmarking
      framework to assess the latest and greatest in the field - so our end users
      can have the best methods available.
