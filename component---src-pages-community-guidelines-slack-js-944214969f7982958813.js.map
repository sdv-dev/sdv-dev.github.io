Discuss and participate openly\n              </p>\n              <p>\n              We created our Slack Community as an open place to discuss the SDV. Anyone can join our community by creating a profile. Whether it's through asking questions, having detailed discussions or reacting to existing conversations, you are welcome to engage with the community in any way you feel comfortable. Feel free to answer questions by replying in a thread, especially if you've run into the same problems in the past or have workarounds.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The guidance below allows us to keep the community safe:\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>We encourage  SDV Slack members to create profiles that accurately represent who they are, including their name, profile image and email. Please do not deliberately change your identity in order to mislead the community, for example by providing a temporary email or a fake name or profile photo. Impersonating others could also result in your expulsion.</li>\n                <li>We encourage everyone to communicate in public channels instead of through private Direct Messages (DMs). When you keep discussions in the public space, everyone in the community can benefit from the solutions that you find, and others can also join in. This also applies to communicating with SDV team members â€” we try to respond to questions on a first-come, first-serve basis, and generally get to everything within a few business days. <strong>You will <i>not</i> receive a faster response by directly messaging individual members of the SDV team.</strong></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-lg my-10 post\">\n              <p className=\"text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold text-sdv-dark\">\n                2.
